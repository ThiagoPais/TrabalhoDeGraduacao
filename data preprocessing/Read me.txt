This is the code for delete, insert and calculate the insert rate.

To keep the inseted files that I created, please change the data path to create a new folder to save the new file, if you want to
create,too. You can follow the instruction in the read me.txt outside this folder.

Since some data after insertion look not well, so I picked some of them to use for further training and testing.
